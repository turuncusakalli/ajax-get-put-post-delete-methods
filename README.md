# ajax-get-put-post-delete-methods

## Hi there! This project's comment lines are in English.

In this project, I've experienced AJAX GET-PUT-POST-DELETE methods. I've learnt how to get data from url, how to edit the data which is on url, how to delete or add new data on it. In my data, I got a location's id number, title, latitude and longitude in JSON Array. When you click the title in my index√ßhtml, it will go to that title's location. The buttons are invisible as default. When you click on any title, you will be able to see that title's buttons down there.

I deleted my Google API key from index.html. You need to use your own API key.
